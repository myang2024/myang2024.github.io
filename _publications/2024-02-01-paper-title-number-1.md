Abstract

Objective
Social media use is shown to be linked to youth's e-cigarette use. However, less is known about the underlying mechanisms. This study examined the mediating roles of internalizing and externalizing problems in the association between youth's social media use and e-cigarette use, and the racial differences in the mediation association.

Methods
The study sample included 4913 U.S. youth from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study Waves 3–5 (2015–2019). Two weighted generalized structural equation models were conducted to examine the mediation pathways between youth's social media use (Wave 3) and past-30-day e-cigarette use (Wave 5) through internalizing and externalizing problems (Wave 4), respectively. Invariance tests were conducted to examine racial group differences.

Results
Youth with high social media use frequency were more likely to use e-cigarettes (total effect: OR = 1.20, p < 0.001 in both internalizing and externalizing models). Internalizing and externalizing problems mediated the aforementioned associations (mediation proportions: 5.05% and 5.66%, respectively). The invariance tests indicated a significant difference between White and non-White groups (both ps < 0.001), where a larger proportion of mediation was found in the non-White group (12.22% for internalizing and 11.99% for externalizing) compared to their White counterparts (2.46% for internalizing and 3.17% for externalizing).

Conclusions
Mental health problems following social media use served as a risk factor for e-cigarette use among youth. Interventions aiming to improve youth's mental health could in turn temper e-cigarette use among youth social media users, and implementing tailored interventions in response to racial differences is warranted.
